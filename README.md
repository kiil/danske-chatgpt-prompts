# Danske chatGPT prompts

Chatbot bygger på en sprogmodel, og ikke et indeks som en søgemaskine. Derfor gælder det om at tænke i mønstre og sammenhænge i stedet for nøgleord.

Et simpelt eksempel som afslører at chatGPT gengiver mønstre i de data der ligger i sprogmodellen, fremfor at forholde sig stringent til et givent spørgsmål, kan du finde her

[Jeg spurgte chat gpt om intelligens og svaret var overraskende menneskeligt](https://www.kiils.dk/erfaring/nlp/chatgpt/)

Som bruger af chatGPT gælder det som regel om at få chatGPT til at fremlægge de mest relevante og brugbare mønstre den har "lært" ud fra de enorme mængder af tekst som den er blevet fodret med.

Sandsynligheden for at ramme brugbare og relevante mønstre stiger hvis man selv gør sig lidt tanker inden man giver chatGPT en opgave via prompten.

I den forbindelse er det ofte frugtbart at give chatGPT en bestemt "rolle", altså et bestemt perspektiv, det kan hjælpe med at sortere mange irrelevante mønstre fra. Og giv så chatGPT noget mere sammenhæng og formuler dens opgave så konkret som muligt.

Strengt taget er meget af det som man skriver i en prompt fyldord, men det gør ikke noget. Derfor betyder det i mange tilfælde heller ikke det store om du formulerer en prompt som "du er en journalist. du vil skrive en historie om ..." og "jeg er en journalist. jeg vil skrive en historie om ...".

Foreløbig afspejler de her benyttede eksempler mine egne behov som journalist, men du er velkommen til at bidrage med relevante prompts på dansk.

Bemærk at chatGPT klarer sig bedre på engelsk.

  I want you to act as a storyteller. You will come up with entertaining stories that are engaging,
   │ imaginative and captivating for the audience. It can be fairy tales, educational stories or any other
   │ type of stories which has the potential to capture people's attention and imagination. Depending on the
   │ target audience, you may choose specific themes or topics for your storytelling session e.g., if it’s
   │ children then you can talk about animals; If it’s adults then history-based tales might engage them
   │ better etc. My first request is "I need an interesting story on perseverance."
 ﮧ │  Once upon a time, there was a small village in the middle of a vast forest. The villagers were
   │ hardworking and honest, but they were also very poor. They had to work hard every day just to make ends
   │ meet.
   │  One day, a young man named John decided to leave the village and go out into the world to seek his
   │ fortune. He said goodbye to his family and friends and set off on his journey.
   │  John traveled for many days and nights, and eventually he came to a large city. He was amazed by the
   │ sights and sounds of the city, but he was also very scared. He had no money and no place to stay.
   │  John decided to look for work, but no one wanted to hire him. He was turned away from every door he
   │ knocked on. He was about to give up when he saw a small shop with a sign that said "Help Wanted".
   │  John went inside and asked the shopkeeper if he could work for him. The shopkeeper said he could, but
   │ he warned John that the job was very hard and he would have to work long hours. John said he was willing
   │ to do whatever it took.
   │  So John started working in the shop. He worked long hours and did whatever the shopkeeper asked of him.
   │ He was determined to make a success of himself.
   │  Months passed and John worked hard. He saved every penny he earned and eventually he was able to open

  │ what happened after john opened his shop
 ﮧ │  John's shop was a great success. He worked hard and was able to make enough money to support himself
   │ and his family. He was able to give back to the community and help those in need.

   │ inspiration to the people of the village and a symbol of perseverance.
   │  John's story is still told today, and it serves as a reminder that with hard work and determination,
   │ anything is possible.
